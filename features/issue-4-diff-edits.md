# Prevent Frequent File Rewrites by Implementing Diff-Based Edits and File Locking

This feature addresses [issue #4](../issues/4), which flags the inefficiency of rewriting entire files whenever the AI modifies code. Currently, Bolt overwrites the full file content for every change, causing unnecessary disk I/O and possible race conditions when multiple writes occur concurrently. Streaming outputs also result in repeated partial writes to the same file.

## Proposed Solution

* **Diff-based updates:** Instead of writing the whole file, the agent should return a unified diff. A new `applyDiff` function will apply patches to the existing file content, using context lines to locate the insertion point. Noâ€¯op writes should be skipped when the diff does not change the file.
* **File locking:** Add a lightweight locking mechanism so that only one write per file happens at a time. When a file is locked, subsequent writes should queue until the lock is released to avoid conflicts.
* **Prompt adjustments:** The prompt template will instruct models to return unified diffs rather than full file contents.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The `applyDiff` helper applies unified diffs correctly and is covered by tests (see `tests/prevent-file-rewrites.test.ts`).
* Files are only updated when the diff changes the content.
* A lock prevents concurrent writes to the same file.
* Documentation is updated to describe the new behavior.
